-----ABOUT-----

This is my demo project which is a game. In this game you can catch the shape that the game tells you in the box at the bottom of the screen with moving the mouse on the mouse section. If you catch the right shape, you will have score, and if you catch the wrong shape or if you don't catch the shape the game needs, you will lose a life. 

enjoy the game!
